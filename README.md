# Core Serve Backend

This repository contains the **Core Serve Backend** service, which powers the backend logic, API endpoints, and core business workflows for the Core Serve platform. It is designed to work in harmony with the [Core Serve Frontend](https://github.com/teejayade2244/core-serve-frontend) (user interface) and [Core Serve GitOps](https://github.com/teejayade2244/core-serve-gitops) (infrastructure automation and CI/CD).

## Overview

- **Core Serve Backend**: Provides secure and scalable RESTful APIs, authentication, business logic, and integrations.
- **Core Serve Frontend**: The user-facing web application, which communicates with this backend service.
- **Core Serve GitOps**: Automates deployments and manages infrastructure using GitOps principles.

## Features

- RESTful API endpoints for all core platform functionality
- User authentication and authorization
- Integration with GitOps for deployment automation
- Containerized with Docker for easy deployment
- CI/CD pipeline configuration with Jenkins
